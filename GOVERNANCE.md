# Liminal Project Governance

This project uses a governance model commonly described as
Benevolent Dictator For Life ([BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)). This document
outlines our implementation of this model.  The process for
contributing is described in a separate document called
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

This project aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. Participants are bound to the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Roles

### User

Anyone who uses the project.

### Contributor

Anyone who has contributed to the project in any way and to any degree. This includes commenters on issues or pull requests, people who add value to the project (whether itâ€™s triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events), or anybody with a merged pull request.

### Committer

Anyone who has commit access to the project. They have an increased role of being responsible leaders of the community and project. Their role includes triaging and reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests. They are also responsible for ensuring the project progresses and remains in a healthy state. All committers will be listed below!

### Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)

The BDFL has final say over all project decisions. They have the final vote on any decisions that cannot be decided by the committers. They are responsible for the project's direction, feature development, and community involvement. The current BDFL is Nirmit Damania \([@ndamania00](https://github.com/ndamania00)\).

## Decision Making Process

In general, we prefer that issues in the community and repository are amicably worked out between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the committers can be called in to decide an issue. If the committers themselves cannot reach a consensus of 70% majority on an issue, the BDFL will have final say.

## Changing Governance

1. The BDFL may choose a replacement at any point and cede authority
    to them. If this happens, the decision must be announced and
    recorded in this governance document. The new BDFL must clearly and publicly state that they accept their new responsibilities.

2. The BDFL may alternatively decide to move to a Steering Committee
    governance model, in which case this document must be replaced with
    a new description of roles and responsibilities.
